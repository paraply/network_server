The concurrent server responds with a round trip time of around 0.1 ms when running on a local computer.

The new connections appear as established and are connected to a unique socket at the server. See netstat status below:

Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State    	PID/Program name  
tcp        0      0 localhost:5000          localhost:59887         ESTABLISHED 1848/server     
tcp        0      0 localhost:59887         localhost:5000          ESTABLISHED 2040/client-simple
tcp        0      0 localhost:59886         localhost:5000          ESTABLISHED 1935/client-simple
tcp        0      0 localhost:5000          localhost:59886         ESTABLISHED 1848/server

Simulating 100 clients with 1000 queries with the concurrent server:


Establishing 100 connections... 
  successfully initiated 100 connection attempts!
Connect timing results for 100 successful connections
  - min time: 11.929699 ms
  - max time: 19.660506 ms
  - average time: 14.598906 ms
 (0 connections failed!)
Roundtrip timing results for 100 connections for 1000 round trips
  - min time: 587.213365 ms
  - max time: 884.338289 ms
  - average time: 875.021400 ms

This is way faster than before when using the non-improved server.
The average connect timing is now 14 ms compared to 5290 ms
The average RTT is now 875 compared to 3873 ms

A simple client is still able to connect and send/receive data even when the multi client is running with
a large sample of connections (1000) and a large amount of queries (10000).
Therefore we can say that the server is now safe from the simple DOS attack.
